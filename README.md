# Robot Simulator

2D online Robot Simulator platform for testing state-of-the-art path planning algorithms in environments with dynamic obstacles.

## TODO

- [ ] write URDF for cobalt
- [ ] add sensors support to URDF parser
- [ ] define environment
- [ ] scale the map to match real world measures
- [ ] move from current, complex, translation and scale logic to
    translate() and scale() on sort of a contextManager object in javascript
- [ ] comment better each function and the overall structure
- [ ] add typing
- [ ] add input checking
- [ ] add radar in gui to see sensors read from the robot
- [ ] provide more control on map generation (e.g. number of each type of obstacles, how to spatially align the static ones and so on...)
