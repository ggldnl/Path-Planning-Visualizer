# Robot Simulator

2D online Robot Simulator platform for testing state-of-the-art path planning algorithms in environments with dynamic obstacles.

## Roadmap

- [ ] define the control loop
- [ ] move from current, complex, translation and scale logic to
    translate() and scale() on sort of a contextManager object,
    that handles these things
- [ ] implement antialiasing (it is normally controlled by the
    browser but there is some way)
